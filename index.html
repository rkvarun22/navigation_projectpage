        <h5>Making Indoor Navigation Smooth and Accessible</h5>
        <p>Indoor wayfinding and service accessibility are challenging, especially if you visit a large indoor facility like healthcare centres, transport terminals, museums and shopping complexes for the first time. Information unavailability and poor accessibility in such facilities have brought these challenges to stand as a mainstream problem for indoor spaces. INCLUNAV provides a compact and scalable solution.</p>
